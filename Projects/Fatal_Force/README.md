# Introduction:

This project tracks and analyzes data related to police killings in the United States. Leveraging data from various sources such as law enforcement websites, local news reports, and social media


# Work Done:

### Data Collection and Preliminary Analysis: 
Collected and analyzed data on police killings, focusing on factors such as race, age, gender, and circumstances of the incident.

### Data Visualization:
Employed various data visualization techniques to present insights, including charts illustrating poverty rates, high school graduation rates, racial demographics, and gender distribution.

### Statistical Analysis: 
Utilized statistical tools such as Seaborn's jointplot, lmplot, and regplot to explore relationships between poverty rates, high school graduation rates, and other variables.

### Exploration of Demographic Factors: 
Examined the racial makeup of each US state, analyzed the racial distribution of individuals killed by police, and compared the total number of deaths by gender.

### Exploration of Circumstantial Factors: 
Investigated factors such as the age of individuals killed, whether they were armed, and whether they were experiencing mental illness at the time of the incident.

### Geospatial Analysis:   
Created a choropleth map to visualize the distribution of police killings across US states.

### Modeling and Prediction: 
Developed models to predict unemployment rates, inflation, and population growth from 1910 to 2020.


# The Population between 1910-2020 section: 

In this section, I delve into historical population data for the United States from 1910 to 2020. I not only analyze the population trends over time but also construct predictive models for key economic indicators such as the unemployment rate, inflation rate, and population growth rate.
