# Introduction:

The project starts with an introduction to the dataset and the overall goals. It then proceeds with installing necessary packages, upgrading Plotly for better visualizations, and importing essential libraries.

# Data Handling:

##### Load the Data: The data is loaded into the notebook.
##### Preliminary Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the data to understand its structure and contents.
##### Data Cleaning: Checking for missing values and duplicates to ensure data quality.
##### Descriptive Statistics: Basic statistics to summarize the data.

# Analysis and Visualization:

##### Number of Launches per Company: Analysis of how many launches each company has conducted.
##### Active vs. Retired Rockets: Comparison of the number of active and retired rockets.
##### Mission Status Distribution: Distribution of mission statuses (e.g., successful, failed).
##### Launch Costs: Analysis of the costs associated with space launches.

# Geospatial Analysis:

##### Choropleth Maps: Visualizing the number of launches and failures by country using choropleth maps.
##### Sunburst Chart: A Plotly sunburst chart showing the hierarchy of countries, organizations, and mission statuses.

# Financial Analysis:

##### Total Spending by Organization: Analysis of the total amount of money spent by each organization on space missions.
##### Spending per Launch: Analysis of how much money each organization spends per launch.

# Temporal Analysis:

##### Launches Over Time: Charting the number of launches per year and month.
##### Popular Launch Months: Identifying the most and least popular months for space launches.
##### Launch Price Over Time: Analyzing how launch prices have varied over time.
##### Top 10 Organizations: Charting the number of launches over time by the top 10 organizations.

# Historical Comparisons:

##### Cold War Space Race: Comparing the USA and USSR in terms of space launches during the Cold War.
##### Pie Chart Comparison: A Plotly pie chart comparing the total number of launches by the USA and USSR.
##### Yearly Launches: Charting the total number of launches year-on-year by the two superpowers.
##### Mission Failures: Charting the total number of mission failures year-on-year.
##### Failure Percentage: Analyzing the percentage of failures over time.
##### Leading Countries: Showing which country was in the lead in terms of total launches for each year up to 2024.
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of space missions, offering insights into launch frequencies, costs, mission outcomes, and historical trends
